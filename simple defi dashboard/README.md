# 🦊 Simple DeFi Dashboard

This is a basic Ethereum dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (using [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.org/)).  
It lets users connect their MetaMask wallet and view balances for:

- ETH
- DAI
- USDC

## 🛠️ How It Works

- Connects to Ethereum via MetaMask
- Reads on-chain token balances using Ethers.js
- Fetches DAI and USDC balances from mainnet contracts
